You could warm your wretchedness on the coals of an imagined eternity with a good looking and good doing person and this made things alright, for forty two daily minutes, anyway. This was all that was necessary for her–the idea of her–to take root in your heart. A balm for your untethered, unextraordinary soul.<br><br>How now you wish you could see her eyes. How you wish you could be convincing her that leaving in anticipation of a more devastating departure is still a departure, and still devastates.<br><br>You tell her you love her anyway and that you have had an interesting day regarding the car, so as much as you would like to come to her, will she please come to you?<br><br>She says she will think about it and hangs up. You hope she will. You pray she will.",
